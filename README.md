# RPGsheet

This was a learning exercise, part of my drive to become a dev.
Basically, it's an RPG character sheet app. I tried two methods which live in their own folders:

htmljs folder:
This method was my first attempt of the week, where I used strict html/css and javascript (to do all the logic) to make the app.

express folder: This was my first full stack js/react app. I delved lightly into react to make a much better version of the rpg sheet app. It looks way better, and the code is nicer than my first attempt, since I didn't have to use JS to do everything for me thanks to React.
